Description:

This project uses image processing techniques to detect game movements and once detected, the game logic uses a min-max algorithm that decides the best response for the robotic arm in order to win the game.
The robotic arm was designed on Solidworks and 3D printed.
Communication between the game and the arm controller was done through serial communication.

Key aspeects:

â€¢ Designed a robotic system that plays Tic-Tac-Toe, combining Python, OpenCV, and Arduino with the Minimax algorithm for real-time decision-making and embedded control.
