# Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O) Robotic Manipulator

## Description
This project combines image processing and game theory to enable a robotic arm to play Tic-Tac-Toe. Using Python and OpenCV, the system detects game moves in real-time. The game logic employs the Minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move. The robotic arm, designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed, is controlled via serial communication with an Arduino.

## Key aspects
- Developed a robotic Tic-Tac-Toe player integrating Python, OpenCV, Arduino, and Minimax for intelligent real-time gameplay.
